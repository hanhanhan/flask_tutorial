Where is the documentation on flask_login.current_user? it's a werkzeug local -- but has more methods -- but methods aren't documented.

Can't figure out where the packages are being installed either to look at source code :(

validator Required is now DataRequired

current_user.confirmed
others need () after 

when I saved a template name with dashes instead of underscores separating words "request_passord_reset.html" vss "request-passsword-reset.html"  -- would not render

order of definition of association object before/after model?

views.py all, followed
Each route sets a cookie with same key to different value - is the cookie being written over? not 2nd cookie being set between followed + all routes?

To do over database:
1. generate roles
2. generate fake user info
3. generate fake post info (from app.models import Post - or add to manage.py to automatically include in shell session)

LAZY LOADING???? When I move 
self.follow(self) to __init__, doesn't work anymore
